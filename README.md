# Scanner-Practice
Utilize the Scanner class to input values into variables you have created. For example, variables for #1 could be cans AND total (theoretically, any value could be entered)

Display your output clearly using printf statements.
1. In the United States, 13 out of every 20 cans are recycled.
What percent of cans are recycled?
(Questions to ask: how many total cans are there? How many were recycled?)

2. Elmer has a collection of 300 fossils. Of these, 21% are fossilized snail shells.
How many fossilized snail shells does Elmer have?
(Questions to ask: how many total fossils are there? What percentage are snail shells?)

Sample equation= 300*(21/100.0)= 300*.21= 63

3. Out of 25 students, 5 students voted for Mark, 11 voted for Bill and 9 voted for Maria.
What percentage voted for Maria? Bill? Mark?
(Consider changing the number of students who voted so that it adds up to more than 25)

4. While waiting for a video game to download, you notice that 30% of 32,000 kilobytes have
